# FreeFall

The FreeFall scripts contain the necessary Python scripts to reproduce the results of manuscript "A robust and straightforward expression for the settling speed of big
spherical atmospheric aerosol", by Mailler et al., 2022, submitted to Geosci. Model Dev.

The physical and mathematical background of the scripts are given in the above-cited study.

freefallmethod.py is a python module to obtain the delta function by solving the equation or by a numerical fit.

stokes.py and vsed.py are the executable scripts which perform the calculations and numerical regressiion, and produce Figs. 1, 2 and 3 of the manuscript.
